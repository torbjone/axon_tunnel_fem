Simple toy example of potential from axon in tunnel.

An animation of the results is included under "fem_axon_tunnel.avi" 

A neural simulation of an axon (based on axon model from Hallermann et al. 2012).
First the NEURON mechanisms must be compiled by executing 'nrnivmodl' in the folder HallermannEtAl2012.
This assumes NEURON is installed.
The neural simulation can then be executed by:
python neural_simulation.py
The positions and transmembrane currents are saved to file.

All Finite Element simulations are done by running:
python axon_tunnel_FEM.py

This will find the FEM solution for each time step.

NOTE: In most cases, it is better to use the reciprocity principle, where a point source
is positioned at each electrode site, and simulated for a unitary charge.
This can be used as a mapping for finding the potential at the electrodes for an arbitrary distribution
of point currents, and for arbitrary time courses.
