Simple toy example of potential from axon in tunnel.

A neural simulation of an axon (based on axon model from Hallermann et al. 2012) can be executed by:
python neural_simulation.py
The positions and transmembrane currents are saved to file.

All Finite Element simulations are done by running:
python axon_tunnel_FEM.py

This will find the FEM solution for each time step.

NOTE: In most cases, it is better to use the reciprocity principle, where a point source
is positioned at each electrode site, and simulated for a unitary charge.
This can be used as a mapping for finding the potential at the electrodes for an arbitrary distribution
of point currents, and for arbitrary time courses.
