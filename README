Simple toy example of potential from axon in tunnel.

A neural simulation of an axon (Hodgkin-Huxley type) can be executed by:
python neural_simulation.py
The positions and transmembrane currents are saved to file.

All Finite Element simulations are done by running:
python electrode_mapping_FEM.py

This will find the FEM solution for a point source at each of the electrode positions. 
Because of the reciprocity principle, this can be used as a mapping for finding the potential at the electrodes for an arbitrary distribution
of point currents in the simulated region.

Based on the neural simulation and the FEM simulation, the predicted potential at the MEA plane can be found by running:
python calculate_mea_potential.py
